# v1.1.8 - 2025-08-10

### Added
- **Bitstamp Exchange (Partial)**: Initial implementation (Market data + subset of standardized API)
  - Implemented: Orderbook(GetOrderbook), Price(GetPrice), Candles(GetCandles), Trades(GetTrades)
  - Partial / Missing: Legacy methods (VerifyStates, GetTickers, etc.), balance/order/funding mapping improvements required
  - Potential duplicate path composition for authenticated endpoints (`ExchangeUrl` contains `/api/v2` while endpoint adds `/v2/`) â€” to be fixed next release
  - Location: `src/exchanges/gb/bitstamp/`

### Changed
- Bitstamp status: "Fully Functional" -> "Partial Implementation (In Progress)"
- Functional exchange count reviewed (remains 10 excluding Bitstamp)

### Notes
- Previous documentation describing Bitstamp as "Full implementation" was inaccurate (multiple `NotImplementedException` + missing legacy parts) and has been corrected
- Bittrex remains excluded from "Functional" classification (standardized trading/funding APIs not implemented)
