# v1.1.11 - 2025-08-24

Maintenance release focusing on XML documentation and build configuration. No functional behavior changes are intended.

### Added
- XML documentation summaries/comments across the standardized exchange interface and multiple adapters
	- Interface: `src/core/interfaces/IExchange.cs` — added comprehensive XML docs for all properties and methods
	- Adapters (representative):
		- `src/exchanges/us/binance/XBinance.cs` — class/ctor summaries, method `<inheritdoc />`, signer docs
		- `src/exchanges/us/kraken/XKraken.cs` — class/ctor summaries, signer/nonce helpers docs, method `<inheritdoc />`
		- `src/exchanges/kr/upbit/XUpbit.cs` — method `<inheritdoc />` annotations
	- Many other regional adapters updated with English comments to align with project guidelines
- Release index updated to include v1.1.11 (`docs/releases/README.md`)

### Changed
- Project: `src/ccxt.simple.csproj`
	- Enable `<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>` to emit XML docs for consumers
	- Adjust `<NoWarn>` to keep CS1591 (missing XML comment) active, encouraging documentation coverage
- Core: `src/core/Exchange.cs` — add `<inheritdoc />` on overridden/implemented members

### Fixed
- No code fixes included in this release

### Breaking Changes
- None

### Migration Notes
- No action required

### Known Issues (carried over)
- Bitstamp remains a partial implementation and may require path composition adjustments for some authenticated endpoints (see v1.1.8)
- Bittrex is not yet classified as "functional" under the standardized trading/funding API surface

### Chore
- `.gitignore`: ignore test result files (`*.trx`) ; ensure release notes remain tracked

### Next
- Continue adding English XML docs where missing and keep the codebase simple while implementing the 16 standardized REST methods per exchange
