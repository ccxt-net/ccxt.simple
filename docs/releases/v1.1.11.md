# v1.1.11 - 2025-08-13

Major release featuring complete Bybit exchange implementation with V5 API support and improved project structure.

### Added
- **Bybit Exchange (FULL Implementation)** - Complete V5 API integration
  - Location: `src/exchanges/cn/bybit/XBybit.cs`
  - All standardized IExchange interface methods implemented
  - V5 Unified Trading API with spot market support
  - HMAC-SHA256 authentication with proper signature generation
  - Complete market data methods (tickers, orderbook, candles, trades)
  - Full trading functionality (place/cancel orders, order history)
  - Account management (balance, account info)
  - Funding operations (deposits, withdrawals, address management)
  - Rate limiting and error handling
  - **V5 API Model Classes** organized by category:
    - `public/`: Market data models (V5Market, V5Instrument)
    - `private/`: Account models (V5Account)
    - `trade/`: Trading models (V5Order)
    - `funding/`: Deposit/withdrawal models (V5Funding)
- **Bybit Exchange Tests** - Comprehensive test suite
  - Location: `tests/exchanges/BybitExchangeTests.cs`
  - 9 test cases covering all major functionality
  - Public API tests (markets, orderbook, candles, trades)
  - Authenticated API tests (balance, account, orders)
  - Automatic skip for auth tests when no credentials configured
- XML documentation summaries/comments across the standardized exchange interface and multiple adapters
  - Interface: `src/core/interfaces/IExchange.cs` — added comprehensive XML docs for all properties and methods
  - Adapters with `<inheritdoc />` annotations for all NotImplementedException methods
  - Many regional adapters updated with English comments to align with project guidelines
- Release index updated to include v1.1.11 (`docs/releases/README.md`)

### Changed
- **Exchange Implementation Tracker** (`docs/TASK.md`)
  - Bybit status updated from SKELETON to FULL
  - Statistics updated: 9 FULL implementations (8.2%), 98 SKELETON (89.1%)
  - Removed Bybit from Tier 1 priority targets (completed)
  - Renumbered remaining priority tiers
- **Contributing Guidelines** (`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`)
  - Added comprehensive "Exchange folder structure" section
  - Documented standard folder organization pattern (public/private/trade/funding)
  - Added guidelines for exchange-specific model classes
  - Included example implementations (Bitget, Bybit)
- **Bybit Implementation** - Migrated from V3 to V5 API
  - Removed obsolete V3 model classes (CoinInfor.cs, CoinState.cs, RaTickers.cs)
  - Restructured models into categorized folders matching project standards
  - Updated namespaces to follow folder structure
- Project: `src/ccxt.simple.csproj`
  - Enable `<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>` to emit XML docs for consumers
  - Adjust `<NoWarn>` to keep CS1591 (missing XML comment) active, encouraging documentation coverage
- Core: `src/core/Exchange.cs` — add `<inheritdoc />` on overridden/implemented members

### Fixed
- **Bithumb Exchange Tests** - Corrected API endpoint and response parsing
  - Fixed incorrect endpoint from `/market/all` to `/public/ticker/ALL_KRW`
  - Fixed response parsing to handle Bithumb's specific JSON structure
  - All 81 tests now passing
- **XML Documentation Warnings** - Resolved all CS1570 warnings
  - Escaped ampersands in URLs (`&` → `&amp;`)
  - Replaced special characters in documentation text

### Breaking Changes
- **Bybit V3 to V5 Migration**
  - Bybit implementation now uses V5 API endpoints exclusively
  - Removed V3 API model classes
  - API response structures have changed
  - Existing Bybit integrations will need to update to V5 API format

### Migration Notes
- **For Bybit users**: Update your code to handle V5 API response formats
  - Model classes have been reorganized into categorized namespaces
  - Response structures follow V5 Unified Trading API specification
  - See Bybit V5 API documentation: https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/intro

### Known Issues (carried over)
- Bitstamp remains a partial implementation and may require path composition adjustments for some authenticated endpoints (see v1.1.8)
- Bittrex is not yet classified as "functional" under the standardized trading/funding API surface

### Chore
- `.gitignore`: ignore test result files (`*.trx`) ; ensure release notes remain tracked

### Next Priority Implementations
Based on updated TASK.md analysis:
1. **BinanceUs** (Tier 1) - Can leverage existing Binance implementation
2. **Bitget** (Tier 2) - Rapidly growing exchange, top 10 by volume
3. **Kucoin/Huobi** (Tier 3) - Complete partial implementations to FULL status
