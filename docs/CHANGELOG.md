#### **New Standardized API Functions**

**Market Data API:**
- `GetOrderbook(string symbol, int limit = 5)` - Get order book data for any exchange
- `GetCandles(string symbol, string timeframe, long? since = null, int limit = 100)` - OHLCV candlestick data
- `GetTrades(string symbol, int limit = 50)` - Recent trade history

**Account & Balance API:**
- `GetBalance()` - Account balance information across all exchanges
- `GetAccount()` - Unified account information structure

**Trading API:**
- `PlaceOrder(string symbol, SideType side, string orderType, decimal amount, decimal? price, string clientOrderId)` - Unified order placement
- `CancelOrder(string orderId, string symbol, string clientOrderId)` - Order cancellation
- `GetOrder(string orderId, string symbol, string clientOrderId)` - Order details retrieval
- `GetOpenOrders(string symbol)` - Active orders management
- `GetOrderHistory(string symbol, int limit)` - Historical order data
- `GetTradeHistory(string symbol, int limit)` - Trade execution history

**Funding & Transfer API:**
- `GetDepositAddress(string currency, string network)` - Deposit address generation
- `Withdraw(string currency, decimal amount, string address, string tag, string network)` - Withdrawal operations
- `GetDepositHistory(string currency, int limit)` - Deposit transaction history
- `GetWithdrawalHistory(string currency, int limit)` - Withdrawal transaction history

#### **Enhanced Data Models**
- **New Unified Types**: `TradeData`, `BalanceInfo`, `AccountInfo`, `OrderInfo`, `TradeInfo`
- **Transfer Types**: `DepositAddress`, `WithdrawalInfo`, `DepositInfo`
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing across all exchange operations

### 🔧 Improvements & Bug Fixes

#### **Backward Compatibility Enhancements**
- **Ticker Class Extensions**: Added compatibility properties for existing code
  - `bid` → alias for `bidPrice`
  - `ask` → alias for `askPrice` 
  - `last` → alias for `lastPrice`
  - `baseVolume` → alias for `volume24h`
  - `quoteVolume` → alias for `volume24h`
  - `minOrderSize` → new property for trading pair requirements

#### **Method Signature Improvements**
- **Namespace Conflict Resolution**: Fixed overlapping method names across exchanges
  - Binance: `GetOrderbook` → `GetOrderbookForTickers` (legacy method)
  - Upbit: `GetOrderbook` → `GetOrderbookForTickers` (legacy method)
  - Coinone: `GetOrderbook` → `GetBestOrders` (legacy method)
  - Bithumb: `GetOrderbook` → `GetRawOrderbook` (legacy method)

#### **Exchange-Specific Implementations**
- **Binance**: Full `GetOrderbook` implementation with actual API integration
- **Bitget**: References existing specialized trading API (`RA.Trade.TradeAPI`)
- **Bithumb**: Legacy Korean exchange API maintained for backward compatibility
- **Coinone**: Complete implementation for Korean market pairs
- **Coinbase**: Complete implementation for USD pairs
- **OKX (formerly OKEx)**: Complete exchange API implementation with domain migration
- **All Other Exchanges**: Consistent `NotImplementedException` with descriptive error messages pending implementation

#### **Code Quality & Build Improvements**
- **Zero Compilation Errors**: Complete solution builds without errors or warnings
- **Nullable Reference Safety**: Fixed all nullable reference warnings in sample projects
- **Test Project Compatibility**: Resolved configuration and disposal issues in test projects
- **Method Visibility**: Corrected explicit interface implementations to public methods

### 🏗️ Architecture & Framework Updates
